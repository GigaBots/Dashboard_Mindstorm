Gigabots Dashboard
====================

A JavaScript web app for controlling LEGO Mindstorm Robots from a computer, phone, or tablet. Powered by the Big Bang platform and uses the Phaser JavaScript framework. This project is funded by the Mozilla Gigabit Community Fund.

Instructions for Use
====================
Use the web app with a Mindstorm robot running the leJOS firmware with the Big Bang Client for Java and custom Gigabot-specific code. The web app uses the Big Bang Client for JavaScript. The custom Gigabot firmware contains a basic API to allow users to program the Gigabot in realtime from a REPL/console in the web app.

Notes
====================
The web app renders fine in Chrome and Safari (on Mac and iPhone) but poorly in Firefox. Not sure about Internet Explorer
